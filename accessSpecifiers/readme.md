### Access Specifier 

1. Public - can access through `any class in any package`.
2. Private - can access by method `only in the same class.` This is the most restrictive access modifier and is `core to the concept of encapsulation`.
3. Protected - can be accessed by other classes in the `same package` or other `sub-classes(childClass) in a different package.`
4. Default - If we don’t mention anything, then default access specifier is used by Java. 
Default access modifier is also called `package-private` , which means that all members are visible `within the same package, but aren’t accessible from other packages.`
